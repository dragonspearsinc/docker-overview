## Introduction

The intent of this project is to introduce us to Docker.  This repository is made up of 2 sample applications, sample-nginx and sample-nodeapp.

## Assumptions

1. You are running on Windows.  These apps may run fine on other OS's or WSL, but I have not tested.  
2. You have an internet connection that will allow you to connect to DockerHub.
